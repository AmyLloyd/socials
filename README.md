Say it on socials and find out what your friends think too.

## Description

My motivation for building this app was to provide a social space where people are able to connect with others, share their thoughts and respond to the thoughts of others. 

The problem this weather dashboard solves is that it is difficult to get in touch with others in our busy lives and being able to post short snippets helps us to keep in touch with those we love. 

I have learnt how to apply routes now using mongoDB and mongoose. My favourite realisation was sending multiple ids in the endpoint and accessing it successfully using req.params. I thought it was logical for multiple ids to work as long as they were defined differently and it did!  

A future direction for this socials app is to add functionality of sharing images. I would also like to see reactions limited to users that are registered, as currently reactions are associated with usernames. These usernames can be whatever the user identifies without needing to be registered. I think being identifiable and registered means that people are more respectful and responsible for their comments. Maybe not though.
